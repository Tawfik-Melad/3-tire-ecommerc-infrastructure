# ⚙️ Basic Infrastructure for [E-Commerce Demo](https://github.com/Tawfik-Melad/e-commerce-demo.git)
Production-ready infrastructure applying key DevOps concepts and best practices for performance, scalability, and automation.

---

## 🚀 Overview
A fully automated AWS-based infrastructure designed to deploy the Django e-commerce application in a secure and scalable environment using Terraform, Ansible, Jenkins, and Docker.

## 🧩 Key Features

### 🏗️ Infrastructure as Code
- AWS resources provisioned using Terraform with an S3 remote backend for centralized state management.  
- Terraform automatically exports outputs to Ansible for seamless environment configuration and deployment.

### 🌐 Web Layer
- Nginx reverse proxy providing additional security and load isolation.  
- Serves static content directly from S3 for improved performance and reduced backend load.  
- Routes requests securely to private backend instances.

### 🐳 Application Layer
- Django backend containerized with Docker for portability and consistency across environments.  
- Backend EC2 instances run in private subnets with no direct public access.  
- Automated static file collection and S3 upload handled during deployment.

### 🗄️ Database Layer
- PostgreSQL RDS deployed across two private subnets in different regions for high availability and redundancy.  
- Database access strictly controlled through dedicated security groups.

### 🔐 Security and Networking
- Complete network isolation with fine-grained security groups per component (Nginx, backend, database).  
- IAM roles assigned for secure S3 and RDS access without static credentials.  
- Private resources remain fully isolated from public exposure.

### ⚙️ CI/CD Automation
- Jenkins EC2 instance deployed within the public subnet for controlled build automation.  
- CI/CD pipeline triggered automatically on GitHub commits to build and push Docker images to DockerHub.  
- Ansible updates backend containers automatically with the latest image version.

## 🧠 Workflow Summary
1. Developer commits code to GitHub.  
2. Jenkins builds and pushes the Docker image to DockerHub.  
3. Ansible deploys the new image to backend EC2.  
4. Django collects and uploads static files to S3.  
5. Nginx serves static content from S3 and proxies requests to backend over private subnet.  
6. Terraform maintains and syncs infrastructure state and variables with Ansible.
